![](Loan.jpg)

Here we are applying Classification Algorithms on a banking data set.

In Banking sector loan is one of the most important products.

All the banks are trying to figure out effective business strategies to persuade customers to apply their loans. However, there are some customers behave negatively after their application are approved. To prevent this situation, banks have to find some methods to predict customersâ€™ behaviours. Machine learning algorithms have a pretty good performance on this purpose, which are widely-used by the banking. Here, I will work on loan behaviours prediction using machine learning models.


This is a classification problem. The data has 615 rows and 13 columns.
 
Here we are giving customer details like gender, marital status, self employed or not, dependents, income, Education, Loan amount etc and expecting output as Yes or No meaans coustomer is eligible to loan or not.
